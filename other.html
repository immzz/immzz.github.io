        <h2>Z-Rally</h2>
        <p>This little racing game was developed in 2006, when I was 15.  Though abandoned for years, I managed to find out a link that still work:</p>

        <h2>The Crime Scene</h2>
        <p>Also developed in 2006, a mystery game. Your mission is to get out of the room use all the items you can collect. Think!</p>

        <h1>Web Design</h1>
        <h2>Xunmeng.org</h2>
        <p><em>A one-on-one fund-raising platform</a></em></p>
        <p>The essential motivation to build this platform rooted from a volunteer activity in Guizhou province in China. We met many children who is eager to go to school but their family can't afford the cost. We collected their basic information and after coming back, we decided to build a website to help.</p>
        <p>The platform is well designed in its donation mechanism. We offer exact family conditions but vague personal information of the children to donors. Once the donor signed an agreement to donate the child, he or she can get more detailed contact information. To ensure the donation actually happens, we have volunteers in the corresponding areas for supervision. The money will not go through us, but directly from the donor to the recipient. With these efforts, we wish to build a direct bridge between donors and recipients.</p>

        <h2>iGEM "Nanjing-China" Team Wiki</h2>
        <p>Team wiki for iGEM 2013. I enjoy working with students from different majors. Our team focused on the research on the herbicide called Atrazine. I was initially a layman on this topic, but I learned a lot by participating in group discussions. Our team was awarded Asia Regional Gold Medal, and I am proud of it.</p>
